\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

This document outlines the Verification and Validation (V\&V) Plan for the McMaster Engineering Society Custom Financial Expense Reporting Platform. The V\&V plan will ensure that the software performs as expected, meets user requirements, is secure, and reliable. The primary goals of this document are to define the objectives, methods, and scope of the V\&V process, covering aspects such as requirements validation, design verification, and system testing.

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

The MES Custom Financial Expense Reporting Platform is a web-based application designed to streamline financial operations for McMaster Engineering Society and its associated student groups. It enables users to submit, review, and track reimbursement requests, create budgets, and manage expenses in a transparent, auditable, and efficient manner. This V\&V Plan outlines the verification and validation processes for ensuring the accuracy, functionality, and security of the software.

\subsection{Objectives}

The primary objective of this V\&V Plan is to confirm that the MES Custom Financial Expense Reporting Platform meets its requirements and operates as intended. The plan aims to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Build confidence in the software's functional correctness and ensure it meets all outlined requirements.
    \item Validate usability by demonstrating a clear, intuitive, and user-friendly interface for all key user roles.
    \item Ensure system security and data integrity, especially regarding sensitive financial data and authorization levels.
\end{itemize}

The plan does not prioritize nonfunctional aspects such as aesthetic design consistency or performance optimizations beyond standard system requirements, as these are not critical to initial functionality and budget constraints.

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

The challenge level for this project is classified as \textbf{General}, aligning with the expectations outlined in the problem statement. The team has chosen to address the critical needs of verification of functionality, security, and usability. No additional extras beyond the required project scope are included in this V\&V Plan.

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

The following documents are relevant to this V\&V plan and provide a basis for verification activities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Software Requirements Specification (SRS)} \citep{SRS}: Defines the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the system, serving as a primary source for validation and test case development.
    \item \textbf{Hazard Analysis}\citep{HazardAnalysis}: Outlines potential system risks and serves as a guide for security testing and fault tolerance validation.
    \item \textbf{Problem Statement}\citep{ProblemStatement}: Provides an overview of the project's purpose, goals, and core functionality requirements, detailing the needs of the McMaster Engineering Society for a streamlined financial reporting platform. It identifies key problems in the current system, justifying the need for an automated, digital solution to enhance efficiency and reliability in financial processes.
    \item \textbf{Development Plan}\citep{DevelopmentPlan}: Outlines the project's development lifecycle, including phases for requirements gathering, design, implementation, and testing. It establishes milestones, assigns roles, and defines the timeline, while ensuring that the team follows best practices in Agile development, with iterative check-ins for verification and validation of functional requirements.
\end{itemize}

These documents establish the foundation for testing activities, allowing each verification and validation activity to target specific functional areas, requirements, or potential risk zones.

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

There will be particular attention to the core requirements of reducing wait times and preventing loss of reimbursement requests. Any changes to requirements identified through validation will be reviewed and updated in the SRS document accordingly.

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}
		
\paragraph{Title for Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs.  Output is not how you
are going to return the results of the test.  The output is the expected
result.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
