\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of MES-ERP}
The \progname{} (McMaster Engineering Society - Expense Reporting Platform) is a web-based application designed to streamline financial operations for the MES and its associated student groups. It provides a centralized platform for submitting, tracking, and managing reimbursement requests, payment requests, and budgets efficiently and transparently.

\subsection{Purpose of this Guide}
This guide provides instructions on how to effectively use the \progname{} platform based on your assigned role(s). It covers common tasks, navigation, and key features to help you manage your financial activities.

\subsection{User Roles Overview}
The platform uses a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. Your capabilities within the application depend on the role(s) assigned to you. Common roles include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Regular User:} Can submit personal requests and view their status.
    \item \textbf{Club/Group Admin:} Can manage requests, budgets, and potentially users/roles for specific groups they oversee.
    \item \textbf{System Admin (MES Staff/Exec):} Has broad access to manage users, roles, groups, requests, budgets, and system-wide settings.
\end{itemize}

\clearpage
\section{Getting Started}

\subsection{Accessing the Platform}
The \progname{} platform is accessible via a web browser on desktops and laptops (Windows, macOS, Linux). It is also accessible on mobile devices (iOS, Android). Ensure you are using a modern browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge. The main URL is \href{https://macengsociety.ca/erp}{https://macengsociety.ca/erp}.

\subsection{Logging In}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Navigate to the login page (typically the application's root URL or \texttt{/login}).
    \item Enter your registered email address and password.
    \item Click the \textbf{Login} button.
    \item Upon successful login, you will be redirected to your dashboard (\texttt{/dashboard/home}).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{login_page.png}
    \caption{Login Page}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Registering a New Account}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item From the login page, click the \textbf{Register} link.
    \item Enter your email address and choose a secure password.
    \item Click the \textbf{Register} button.
    \item You may need to check your email to confirm your registration before you can log in.
    \item Upon first login after registration, a user profile will be created for you with a default "user" role.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{register_page.png}
    \caption{Registration Page}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dashboard Overview (\texttt{/dashboard/home})}
This is your main landing page after logging in. It provides a quick overview of relevant statistics based on your role:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Regular Users:} See stats for \textit{your} submitted requests (count, total amount).
    \item \textbf{Club Admins:} May see stats for \textit{your club's} requests (total count, amount, pending count) in addition to your personal stats, depending on permissions.
    \item \textbf{System Admins:} See system-wide stats (total requests, total amount, pending count, total users).
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{user_dashboard.png}
    \caption{User Dashboard Home Page}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Navigating the Platform (Header \& Sidebar)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Header:} The header (maroon/dark blue bar at the top) contains the main navigation links (Home, Requests, Users, etc.). The links visible depend on your permissions. It also includes theme toggles, a link to this guide (\texttt{/dashboard/guide}), and the user menu (profile icon).
    \item \textbf{User Menu:} Clicking the profile icon in the header opens a dropdown to access your "Account" page (\texttt{/dashboard/accountInfo}) or "Sign Out".
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{header.png}
    \caption{Header with Navigation Links and User Menu}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Theme Selection (Light/Dark)}

Your dashboard (\texttt{/dashboard/home}) may show aggregated statistics for the specific club(s) you manage, such as total requests, total amount spent, and pending requests within those clubs, in addition to your personal stats.

\subsection{Viewing Club Requests (Payment \& Budget) (\texttt{/dashboard/requests})}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Navigate to the \textbf{Requests Page}.
    \item The tables here will display requests associated with the group(s) you have permission to view.
    \item Use the tabs (\textbf{Payment Requests}, \textbf{Budget Requests}) to switch between request types for your group(s).
\end{enumerate}

Follow the same process as Regular Users (Section 3.2), ensuring you select the correct Club/Group in the form.

\subsection{Submitting Annual Budget Forms (\texttt{/dashboard/annual\_form})}

\section{Key Features Overview}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reimbursement Form \& OCR:} The \texttt{/forms} page allows detailed submission of requests. It includes an OCR feature to automatically read the total amount from uploaded receipt images (PDF, JPG, PNG).

    \item \textbf{Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):} The system uses a flexible RBAC model where permissions are tied to roles, and roles can be global or specific to certain groups. Users can hold multiple roles across different groups.
    \item \textbf{Notifications (Email/SMS):} Users are automatically notified via email (and potentially SMS if phone numbers are configured and Twilio is set up) when the status of their payment requests changes.
    \item \textbf{Analytics Dashboard:} The \texttt{/dashboard/analytics} page offers various charts and tables to visualize financial data, helping with oversight and decision-making.
\end{itemize}

\section{Troubleshooting \& FAQ}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{I can't log in.}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ensure you are using the correct email and password.
            \item Try resetting your password via the link on the login page (if available).
            \item If you registered recently, check your email for a confirmation link.
            \item Contact MES support if problems persist.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Why can't I see requests from other clubs?}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Access is based on your assigned roles and permissions. Regular users typically only see their own requests. Club Admins see requests for their specific club(s). Only System Admins can see all requests.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{My request status hasn't changed.}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Processing times can vary. Please allow a few business days for review. You will receive a notification when the status is updated. If it takes unusually long, contact your club admin or MES Finance.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The OCR didn't read my receipt amount correctly.}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item OCR accuracy can depend on image quality and layout. Please manually verify and correct the "Amount Requested" field in the form if the OCR result is inaccurate.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
