\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
The McMaster Engineering Society is looking to develop a finance and accounting system that will streamline the financial operations of 60 student groups. Due to recent struggles in managing and keeping track of reimbursement requests, many students must endure long wait times during the process. The implementation of our solution will allow the MES to provide users with adequate tracking of reimbursement requests, reduce the loss of requests, and lower wait times.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
Currently, the MES is losing track of reimbursement requests made, resulting in long wait times and lost money. We aim to provide a solution that effectively manages and organizes the large volume of reimbursement requests sent. The effectiveness of our solution will be measured based on how well it reduces wait times and how many requests are lost. Additionally, we plan on implementing custom budget creation and tracking for all users. Through this, users will be able to effectively create and manage budgets for different categories, and all transactions will be tracked in real time. This will allow users to gain financial oversight, ultimately preventing them from going over budget. Custom budgets should be categorized correctly nine times out of ten. The system should also reduce reimbursement turnover time for users, improving the claim process. Finally, the solution should be easy for users to understand and use. There should be an intuitive way to create reimbursement requests, and if required, users will be provided with extra instructions where needed.

\section{System Overview} 
In this section, the system architecture and general flow of how users will interact with the system are detailed.

\section{Tasks}
\subsection{Project Planning}
An Agile approach (e.g., Scrum) will be used to iteratively refine requirements and deliverables.

\subsection{Planning of the Development Phases}
\begin{longtable}{| m{3cm} | m{10cm} |}
  \hline
  \textbf{Step} & \textbf{Description} \\
  \hline
  \textbf{1. Requirements Gathering} & Ongoing collaboration with stakeholders to define user stories and acceptance criteria. \\
  \hline
  \textbf{2. Sprint Planning} & Select and prioritize tasks from the backlog for each 1--4 week sprint. \\
  \hline
  \textbf{3. Design and Architecture} & Establish initial data models and system design, refining as needed. \\
  \hline
  \textbf{4. Development} & Implement features, coordinating with testers for immediate feedback. \\

\end{longtable}

\subsection{Requirement Priority}

The following outlines the priority levels for each category of requirements in this SRS, along with brief rationales. These priorities guide the order in which features should be addressed during development when resources (time, budget) are constrained.

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Functional Requirements (Highest Priority)} \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Core functionalities like request submission, approval workflows, and admin oversight (FR-001, FR-002, FR-003, and FR-004) form the backbone of the system. Without these features, the MES cannot handle reimbursements effectively.

    \item \textbf{Security and Privacy Requirements (High Priority)} \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Financial data is sensitive. Ensuring controlled access, encryption, and adherence to legal standards (e.g., PIPEDA) is critical to user trust and regulatory compliance. Security failures can severely undermine the system’s viability.

    \item \textbf{Compliance Requirements (High Priority)} \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Meeting legal (PIPEDA, AODA) and industry standards (ISO/IEC 27001) is non-negotiable for a financial platform. Non-compliance can lead to legal repercussions and reputational damage.

    \item \textbf{Performance Requirements (Medium–High Priority)} \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} The system must reliably manage peak loads and handle concurrent users. While performance optimization can occur iteratively, unacceptable lag or downtime would undermine user confidence and adoption.

    \item \textbf{Usability and Accessibility Requirements (Medium Priority)} \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} A user-friendly interface and features like high-contrast mode encourage adoption and reduce errors. Though essential for overall success, these can be refined after the core reimbursement logic is in place.

    \item \textbf{Look and Feel Requirements (Medium Priority)} \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Maintaining a clean, professional interface supports a positive user experience, especially important for financial transactions. However, basic functionality and security must still take precedence.

    \item \textbf{Maintainability and Support Requirements (Medium Priority)} \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Ensuring the codebase is well-documented and easily extensible will save time and costs in the long run, especially if MES processes change or the platform expands to serve more groups. While it may not block initial launch, neglecting maintainability increases technical debt.

    \item \textbf{Operational and Environmental Requirements (Medium Priority)} \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} The system’s environment (offices, MES-provided hardware) and adjacency to other processes (e.g., budget committees, cloud backups) must be stable to avoid downtime. This stability underpins successful day-to-day usage.

    \item \textbf{Cultural Requirements (Low–Medium Priority)} \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Respectful, inclusive language and British spelling (as required by McMaster conventions) are important but do not hinder core financial workflows. These can be verified or adjusted without blocking core features.

    \item \textbf{Longevity Requirements (Medium Priority)} \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Building the system to last at least five years is valuable for ROI and operational continuity; however, it can be balanced with immediate functional needs and iterative improvements.

\end{itemize}

\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
N/A --- No official migration of legacy data is currently mandated. Historical files remain in their existing formats unless otherwise requested.

\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
N/A --- No translation of old data is required for the first release. Further data integration can be explored later.

\section{Costs}
\subsection{Labor Costs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Development Hours}: Estimated 400--500 hours to implement key features (reimbursement flow, approvals, budgeting).
    \item \textbf{Testing Hours}: Estimated 50--70 hours for comprehensive testing (unit, integration, acceptance).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Monetary Costs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Server Operating Costs}: \$10--\$20 monthly for electricity and basic upkeep of MES’s local server.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional Considerations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Maintenance Costs}: 5--10 hours monthly for bug fixes and feature updates.
    \item \textbf{Backup Budget}: 10--20 hours set aside for unforeseen issues or requirement changes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Likely Changes}
Potential future additions include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A mobile app for instant expense submission.
  \item Machine learning-based receipt categorization to minimize manual data entry.
  \item Customizable dashboards for different user roles.
  \item Multi-language support to serve a broader community.
  \item Historical data import from prior systems.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Ideas for Solution}
A web-based finance and accounting solution using JavaScript, NextJS, React, and Git is proposed to handle the MES’s reimbursement challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Streamlines submission with digital receipts and real-time status tracking.
    \item Offers automated notifications for both submitters and administrators.
    \item Includes budget oversight and multiple approval levels to prevent lost requests.
\end{itemize}
TypeScript will serve as the main language. NextJS handles front-end and back-end, with React providing a responsive, interactive UI. Git supports version control for collaborative development.
