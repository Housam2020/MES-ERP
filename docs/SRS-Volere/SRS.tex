\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
The McMaster Engineering Society is looking to develop a finance and accounting system that will streamline the financial operations of 60 student groups. Due to recent struggles managing and keeping track of reimbursement requests, many students must wait large wait times during the process. The implementation of our solution will allow the MES to provide users with adequate tracking of reimbursement requests made as well as reduce the loss of requests and lower wait times.


\subsection{Goals of the Project}
Currently, the MES is losing track of reimbursement requests made resulting in large wait times and loss of money. We aim to provide a solution that effectively manages and organizes the large throughput of reimbursement requests sent. The effectiveness of our solution will be measured based on how well it reduces wait times as well as how many requests are lost.

Additionally, we plan on implementing custom budget creation and tracking for all users. Through this, users will be able to effectively create and manage budgets for different categories and all transactions will be tracked in real time. This would allow users to gain financial oversight, ultimately preventing going over budget. Custom budgets should be categorized correctly 95% of the time.

\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}
The client for this project is the McMaster Engineering Society (MES). The MES financially supports 60 different student groups and numerous individuals throughout the year through a reimbursement model. The society is responsible for approving the final product and ensuring it meets the needs of the student groups.
The MES invests in this platform to streamline financial processes, reduce administrative overhead, and improve user experience for students and administrators.

\subsection{Customer}
The primary customers of this platform are the student groups and administrative personal who utilize the reimbursement system. Their roles and responsibilities include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Expense Submission:} Student leaders and members will be submitting expense reports, requiring a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process.
    \item \textbf{Feedback Providers:} Customers will offer feedback on system usability and required features, which is critical for ensuring the platform meets their expectations.
    \item \textbf{User Adoption:} The willingness of these customers to adopt the new system will largely depend on its functionality and ease of use, impacting the overall success of the project.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholders include individuals and groups that may influence or be impacted by the product. Their roles are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Student Group Leaders:} Responsible for managing their group's finances, they will provide insights into the specific needs and challenges they face in the current reimbursement process.
    \item \textbf{MES Administrative Staff:} These individuals assist in processing reimbursements and will need training on the new system to ensure smooth operations.
    \item \textbf{McMaster Administion:} The MSU and Financial Affairs office of McMaster will require compliance and tracking features to ensure that all financial activities are documented and adhere to regulations.
    \item \textbf{MES IT:} Involved in the integration of the platform with existing systems, they will need detailed documentation and support for maintenance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
Hands-on users are the individuals who will directly interact with the platform. Their characteristics include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Student Leaders:} Typically aged 18-25, they manage club finances, possess an intermediate amount of technological experience, and are familiar with digital forms and spreadsheets. They would prioritize an intuitive interface that simplifies expense reporting.
    \item \textbf{Administrators:} Members of the MES staff that are aged 18-25, these users manage the overall reimbursement process, have intermediate technological experience, and require efficient tools for tracking and reviewing submissions.
    \item \textbf{Financial Administrators:} Experienced professionals (aged 30+) with an advanced understanding of financial compliance, they need robust reporting features to analyze and audit transactions effectively.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Personas}
The development of personas helps to understand user needs more concretely. Examples include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Alex, the Student Leader:} 20 years old, manages a student club. Familiar with Google Forms and spreadsheets, Alex seeks efficiency in submitting reimbursement requests and values features that save time, such as automated data entry.
    \item \textbf{Jamie, the Administrator:} 35 years old, processes reimbursements for multiple student groups. Jamie values accuracy and compliance and prefers tools that provide a clear overview of submissions and their statuses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}
Understanding user priorities is critical for product success:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Key Users:} Student leaders are crucial to the project's success. They must be able to submit expenses easily and effectively in order for this project to be successful. Their requirements will take precedence due to their direct interaction with the system.
    \item \textbf{Secondary Users:} MES Administrators who facilitate the reimbursement process are equally as important, but their needs will be prioritized lower than those of key users.
    \item \textbf{Unimportant Users:} Casual users with minimal interaction, such as infrequent users of the system, will have their requirements considered last, as they do not impact the product's long-term success.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Participation}
User participation is vital for gathering accurate requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Requirements Gathering:} Key users will participate in interviews and surveys to provide insights into their needs and expectations. We will need to document how a typical expense and reimbursement occours, from the time it is submitted into the current expese system to the final payout of the expense to the user. This will provide a clear overview of how the current system works, what the roadblocks are and how we can optimize the tool to the needs of the users.
    \item \textbf{Usability Testing:} Hands-on users will be invited to participate in usability testing sessions to ensure the platform meets their requirements.
    \item \textbf{Regular Check-Ins:} Scheduled meetings with key users will provide ongoing opportunities for feedback and validation throughout the development process.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Maintenance Users and Service Technicians}
Maintenance users play a vital role in the long-term success of the platform:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MES IT Staff:} Responsible for system updates and troubleshooting, they will require detailed documentation on the platform's functionalities to effectively manage its operation. These users ensure the platform runs smoothly, addressing any technical issues that arise and implementing updates as necessary.
\end{itemize}

\section{Waiting Room}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A mobile app version of the platform should be developed for easier on-the-go access to financial tracking and submissions. \\
  Rationale: A dedicated mobile app would improve accessibility for users who need to submit expenses or view budgets while away from their desktops. Although this would be beneficial, it is not critical for the platform's core functionality as responsive design already ensures usability on mobile devices.
  \item Implement machine learning-based expense categorization to automatically categorize expenses based on historical data. \\
  Rationale: Automated categorization of expenses would reduce manual entry and improve accuracy, providing an intelligent system that learns from user inputs. This is a technically complex feature that could be revisited after the platform's initial release.
  \item Provide users with customizable dashboards where they can select and prioritize the financial metrics most relevant to them. \\
