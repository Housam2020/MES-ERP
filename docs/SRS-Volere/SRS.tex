\section{Look and Feel Requirements}
\subsection{Appearance Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The platform must adhere to the established MES color scheme of maroon, white, and red to ensure a consistent visual identity across all MES platforms. \\
  Rationale: This creates a seamless brand experience for users who are familiar with MES's website and other communications.
  \item The platform must be fully responsive to adjust seamlessly to various screen sizes including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. \\
  Rationale: Many users, especially students, are likely to access the platform from mobile devices. A responsive design ensures the platform is accessible to all users.
  \item  Animations should be kept minimal and used only when necessary to avoid distractions. \\
  Rationale: Minimal animation improves the user experience through feedback, without being very distracting, hence keeping the focus on the functionality of the platform.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Style Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The system must not have elements that depict violence, nudity or language that is discriminatory, vulgar, or derogatory. \\ 
  Rationale: The system should not offensive or inappropriate to users.
  \item There will be no visually unpleasing elements such as colour combinations that strain the eyes. \\ 
  Rationale: There should not be any elements that make the application harder to read.
  \item The platform’s tone should remain professional and formal. \\
  Rationale: A professional tone builds trust with users by emphasizing the seriousness of the platform, particularly given its purpose in handling financial workflows.
  \item Form fields should be simple and clear, with error states highlighted in red to help users easily identify and correct mistakes. \\
  Rationale: Well-designed form fields minimize confusion during data entry, while clear error messages guide users through resolving issues.
  \item Clear and intuitive icons should be used for navigation and key actions, such as submitting expenses or reviewing approvals. \\
  Rationale: Icons provide immediate visual cues that reduces the need for text explanations.

\section{Cultural Requirements}
\subsection{Cultural Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The application must be available in English. \\
  Rationale: English is the primary language spoken by citizens in Ontario and thus shall be the primary method of communication.
  \item The application shall use British spelling. \\
  Rationale: As the application is for use within McMaster University, the predominant spelling method is using British spelling.
  \item The system must be designed to be inclusive and usable by people from diverse cultural, linguistic, and social backgrounds. This includes ensuring gender-neutral language and avoiding culturally biased terms. \\
  Rationale:  MES is a diverse community composed of students and staff from various cultural and linguistic backgrounds. The platform must reflect this diversity by avoiding assumptions about users' cultural norms or preferences.
  \item The platform should allow users to input and view dates and times in different time zones and formats (e.g., 24-hour vs 12-hour clock, day-month-year vs month-day-year formats). \\
  Rationale: MES includes international students and staff who may be accustomed to different time zones and date formats. Flexibility in how time and dates are presented enhances the usability for these diverse users.

\section{Waiting Room}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A mobile app version of the platform should be developed for easier on-the-go access to financial tracking and submissions. \\
  Rationale: A dedicated mobile app would improve accessibility for users who need to submit expenses or view budgets while away from their desktops. Although this would be beneficial, it is not critical for the platform’s core functionality as responsive design already ensures usability on mobile devices.
  \item Implement machine learning-based expense categorization to automatically categorize expenses based on historical data. \\
  Rationale: Automated categorization of expenses would reduce manual entry and improve accuracy, providing an intelligent system that learns from user inputs. This is a technically complex feature that could be revisited after the platform's initial release.
  \item Provide users with customizable dashboards where they can select and prioritize the financial metrics most relevant to them. \\
  Rationale: Customizable dashboards allow users to personalize their experience and focus on the data that matters most to them. While this is an attractive feature, it can be delayed until after the core dashboard functionalities are developed.
  \item Enable multi-language functionality, allowing users to switch between different languages for a more inclusive experience. \\
  Rationale: MES is a diverse community with users from various linguistic backgrounds. Multi-language support would enhance accessibility and usability for all users. However, this feature is not critical for the platform's initial release and can be considered in future updates.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
