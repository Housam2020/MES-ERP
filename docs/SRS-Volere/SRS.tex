\section{Waiting Room}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A mobile app version of the platform should be developed for easier on-the-go access to financial tracking and submissions. \\
  Rationale: A dedicated mobile app would improve accessibility for users who need to submit expenses or view budgets while away from their desktops. Although this would be beneficial, it is not critical for the platformâ€™s core functionality as responsive design already ensures usability on mobile devices.
  \item Implement machine learning-based expense categorization to automatically categorize expenses based on historical data. \\
  Rationale: Automated categorization of expenses would reduce manual entry and improve accuracy, providing an intelligent system that learns from user inputs. This is a technically complex feature that could be revisited after the platform's initial release.
  \item Provide users with customizable dashboards where they can select and prioritize the financial metrics most relevant to them. \\
  Rationale: Customizable dashboards allow users to personalize their experience and focus on the data that matters most to them. While this is an attractive feature, it can be delayed until after the core dashboard functionalities are developed.
  \item Enable multi-language functionality, allowing users to switch between different languages for a more inclusive experience. \\
  Rationale: MES is a diverse community with users from various linguistic backgrounds. Multi-language support would enhance accessibility and usability for all users. However, this feature is not critical for the platform's initial release and can be considered in future updates.
