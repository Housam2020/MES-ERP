\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

The MES-ERP system represents a significant advancement over the previous implementation, which relied on Google Forms for expense submissions and spreadsheets for budget tracking and reimbursement processing. This section compares the two implementations across several key dimensions.

\subsection{Process Efficiency}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Previous Implementation:} The Google Forms and spreadsheets approach required manual data transfer between systems. Staff had to copy information from form submissions into tracking spreadsheets, manually update status changes, and communicate updates via separate email threads.
    
    \item \textbf{MES-ERP:} The new system provides an end-to-end digital workflow where data flows automatically through the system. Once a request is submitted, it remains in the database and can be tracked, updated, and processed without manual data re-entry.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Experience}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Previous Implementation:} Users had to navigate to different Google Forms for different types of requests. After submission, they had limited visibility into the status of their requests and often had to follow up via email.
    
    \item \textbf{MES-ERP:} Users now have a centralized dashboard where they can submit different types of requests, track the status of all their submissions, and receive automatic email notifications when their request status changes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Role-Based Access Control}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Previous Implementation:} Access control was limited to basic Google permissions. Different spreadsheets were shared with different stakeholders, creating information silos and making it difficult to maintain a comprehensive view of financial activities.
    
    \item \textbf{MES-ERP:} The system implements a sophisticated role-based access control system that allows for fine-grained permission management. Users can be assigned specific roles (e.g., club admin, MES executive) with appropriate permissions, ensuring they can access only the information and functions relevant to their responsibilities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Budget Management}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Previous Implementation:} Budget tracking was done in separate spreadsheets, making it difficult to get real-time insights into spending patterns or remaining budgets. Annual budget planning was a separate process with limited integration to actual spending.
    
    \item \textbf{MES-ERP:} The system integrates budget planning and expense tracking in a single platform. The operating budget module allows for detailed budget planning, while the analytics dashboard provides real-time visibility into spending patterns, budget utilization, and financial trends.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Notification System}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Previous Implementation:} Status updates and approvals were communicated manually via email, leading to delays and sometimes missed communications.
    
    \item \textbf{MES-ERP:} The system includes an automated notification system that sends emails to users when their request status changes, providing clear information about the current status and expected next steps.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Group Management}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Previous Implementation:} Group affiliations were tracked manually in spreadsheets, making it difficult to enforce group-specific budget limits or permissions.
    
    \item \textbf{MES-ERP:} The system includes dedicated group management functionality, allowing administrators to create and manage groups, assign users to groups, and enforce group-specific budget allocations and permissions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Analytics and Reporting}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Previous Implementation:} Generating reports or analytics required manual data extraction and processing from multiple spreadsheets.
    
    \item \textbf{MES-ERP:} The system includes a built-in analytics dashboard that provides visualizations of spending patterns, budget utilization, request volumes, and other key metrics, enabling data-driven decision making.
\end{itemize}

The MES-ERP system has successfully addressed the key limitations of the previous implementation, providing a more efficient, transparent, and user-friendly platform for managing the MES financial processes. The integration of reimbursement requests, budget planning, user role management, and automated notifications into a single system has significantly improved the overall experience for both users submitting requests and administrators managing the financial processes.

\section{Unit Testing}

Unit testing was conducted using a combination of automated and manual testing to ensure key functionalities worked as expected. The primary objectives were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Verify that critical features, such as reimbursement submissions and approvals, group creation, and user management work correctly.
    \item Identify and resolve potential errors early in the development cycle.
    \item Ensure that the system remains stable after modifications.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testing Approach}
The team used \textbf{Jest} for automated testing of frontend logic and API calls, and \textbf{manual testing} for real-world scenario validation. The approach included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Writing unit tests for key functions such as group creation, deletion, and authentication handling.
    \item Conducting manual test runs where team members acted as users submitting and approving reimbursement requests.
    \item Gathering feedback from a small group of MES student leaders who tested the platform and provided insights.
    \item Running scenario-based testing sessions to simulate real-world usage, such as handling multiple reimbursement requests at once.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unit Test Cases}
The test cases covered core functionalities, including validation checks and API interactions:

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}

To ensure the robustness and reliability of the \progname{} system, we will use a combination of code coverage metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our testing. The goal of code coverage analysis is to measure the extent to which the source code is tested, helping identify untested paths and potential vulnerabilities.

\subsection{Code Coverage Measurement Approach}
The following strategies were used to assess the coverage of our codebase:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Statement Coverage}: Verifies that each executable statement in the code has been executed at least once.
    \item \textbf{Branch Coverage}: Ensures that both the expected inputs and the expected alerts for wrong inputs are executed (if/else).
    \item \textbf{Function Coverage}: Confirms that all functions and methods in the system have been called at least once.
    \item \textbf{Line Coverage}: Measures the percentage of total lines of code executed during testing.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? \\
  \textbf{Omar:} What went well while writing this deliverable was the structured approach we took from the beginning. By clearly defining our Verification and Validation (VnV) strategy early on, we were able to efficiently organize the document and ensure all necessary components were included. 

  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them? \\
    \textbf{Omar:} One of the main pain points I experienced during this deliverable was ensuring that the VnV plan aligned with our actual testing process and our original VnV plan. To accomodate for this I just went back and forth between documents and talked to my team to ensure I did not mix anything up.

  \item Which parts of this document stemmed from speaking to your client(s) or
  a proxy (e.g. your peers)? Which ones were not, and why? \\
    \textbf{Team:} The majority of this document stemmed from discussions with my peers, as we collectively determined the best approach for verification and validation. Specific sections, such as requirements and changes due to testing all stem from our stakeholders. We built upon what we know from our stakeholders for those sections. Other sections were built upon feedback received from stakeholders as well as the TA/Professor, we made sure to account for all information provided to us to ensure a complete report. 

  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.) \\
  \textbf{Team: } The actual VnV activities differed slightly from the original plan, primarily due to adjustments made during the development cycle. Some test cases had to be modified or expanded as we encountered new scenarios that were not initially anticipated, such as specific security vulnerabilities and data integrity concerns. The biggest change was in prioritizing additional integration tests over certain lower-priority unit tests, since we found that issues were more likely to arise in cross-module interactions. These changes occurred because real-world implementation often reveals gaps in planning, and some verification methods turned out to be less effective than expected. In future projects, I would anticipate these changes by leaving more flexibility in the VnV plan and incorporating iterative updates based on early testing feedback.
