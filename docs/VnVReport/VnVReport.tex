\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

This section will not be appropriate for every project.

\section{Unit Testing}

Unit testing was conducted using a combination of automated and manual testing to ensure key functionalities worked as expected. The primary objectives were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Verify that critical features, such as reimbursement submissions and approvals, group creation, and user management work correctly.
    \item Identify and resolve potential errors early in the development cycle.
    \item Ensure that the system remains stable after modifications.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testing Approach}
The team used \textbf{Jest} for automated testing of frontend logic and API calls, and \textbf{manual testing} for real-world scenario validation. The approach included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Writing unit tests for key functions such as group creation, deletion, and authentication handling.
    \item Conducting manual test runs where team members acted as users submitting and approving reimbursement requests.
    \item Gathering feedback from a small group of MES student leaders who tested the platform and provided insights.
    \item Running scenario-based testing sessions to simulate real-world usage, such as handling multiple reimbursement requests at once.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unit Test Cases}
The test cases covered core functionalities, including validation checks and API interactions:

  \hline
  
  \end{longtable}


\subsection{Edge Cases Tested}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Submitting a reimbursement request without required fields.
  \item Uploading incorrect file formats for receipts.
  \item Attempting to create a duplicate group.
  \item Handling multiple users modifying the same data simultaneously.
  \item Ensuring database rollback occurs when a transaction fails.
  \item Registering a user with an invalid email format.
  \item Assigning multiple roles to a user and verifying access control.
  \item Submitting a payment request with an incorrect amount format.
  \item Preventing unauthorized users from updating request statuses.
  \item Ensuring bulk request approvals work correctly.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes Due to Testing}

Based on the testing process and feedback from users, the following modifications were made to the system:

\subsection{Bug Fixes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fixed an issue where reimbursements submitted without attachments were still being processed.
  \item Addressed a bug where users could submit duplicate requests.
  \item Resolved a login issue where incorrect error messages were displayed.
  \item Fixed a bug where request status updates were not properly reflected in the UI.
  \item Added the ability for users to be in multiple groups.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Feedback and Enhancements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Improved the \textbf{receipt upload system} by making the file upload process clearer.
  \item Enhanced \textbf{audit logging} for better tracking of request status changes.
  \item Added a clearer role management interface to reduce confusion when assigning roles.
  \item Improved user experience by adding filters to search for specific payment requests.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance and Security Improvements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implemented basic input validation to prevent incorrect data submissions.
  \item Reduced system load times by optimizing database queries.
  \item Strengthened authentication by enforcing stricter password requirements.
  \item Enhanced role-based access control to prevent unauthorized modifications.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item Which parts of this document stemmed from speaking to your client(s) or
  a proxy (e.g. your peers)? Which ones were not, and why?
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
