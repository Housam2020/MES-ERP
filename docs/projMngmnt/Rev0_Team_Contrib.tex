This document summarizes the contributions of each team member for the Rev 0
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the POC demo and the Rev
0 demo.

\section{Demo Plans}

For our upcoming Proof of Concept (POC) demo, we will showcase the core functionalities of the website, building on the features demonstrated previously. The goal is to highlight both the established and newly added functionalities, ensuring a user-friendly and efficient design. The demo will include the following features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authentication System:} Users will be able to register, log in, and be assigned a role (user or admin) to access their respective dashboards.
    
    \item \textbf{User and Admin Dashboards:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{User Dashboard:} The user will have access to a form for submitting reimbursement requests. Once a form is submitted, the user can view the status of their request, which will be updated as the request progresses.
        \item \textbf{Admin Dashboard:} The admin will be able to view all reimbursement requests submitted by users. Admins can update the status of each request (in progress, accepted, rejected), and these status changes will be reflected on the user's dashboard.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{New Features:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Image Processing for Receipt Scanning:} A new feature allowing users to upload receipt images, which will be automatically scanned to extract relevant details, reducing manual input requirements.
        \item \textbf{Personalized User Entries:} Enhanced functionality to personalize and save user-specific information, reducing redundancy in input for repeated submissions.
        \item \textbf{User Manual and Tutorials:} A comprehensive guide and set of tutorials will be provided to assist users in navigating the application, ensuring smooth onboarding and efficient utilization of the system.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This demo will serve as the first revision of our proof of concept, focusing on demonstrating essential functionalities alongside key enhancements. The emphasis remains on delivering a seamless user experience, with features such as registration, dashboard navigation, receipt scanning, request submission, request review, and status updates working as intended. 

This foundational demonstration will pave the way for future development and refinement as the project progresses.


\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the
time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting
issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total
number of team meetings held by the team.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & Num\\
Name 1 & Num\\
Name 2 & Num\\
Name 3 & Num\\
Name 4 & Num\\
Name 5 & Num\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & 1\\
Sufyan Motala & 1\\
Rachid Khneisser & 1\\
Housam Alamour & 1\\
Omar Muhammad & 1\\
Taaha Atif & 1\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The count is only 1 because we only met with our supervisor for one meeting so far since the POC demo. We have scheduled weekly meetings so this will be better moving forward.

\section{Lecture Attendance}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & 1\\
Sufyan Motala & 1\\
Rachid Khneisser & 1\\
Housam Alamour & 1\\
Omar Muhammad & 0\\
Taaha Atif & 0\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Only the lecture discussing the rev 0 demo was attended by the team. Not all members could make it, but updates were provided in our Discord for those who missed.

\section{TA Document Discussion Attendance}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & 1\\
Sufyan Motala & 1\\
Rachid Khneisser & 1\\
Housam Alamour & 1\\
Omar Muhammad & 1\\
Taaha Atif & 1\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The count is only 1 because we only met with the TA once for our informal meeting to discuss the design docs (MG/MIS).

\section{Commits}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\
\midrule
Total & 288 & 100\% \\
Housam Alamour & 69 & 24\% \\
Sufyan Motala & 49 & 17\% \\
Omar Muhammad & 37 & 13\% \\
Rachid Khneisser & 44 & 15\% \\
Taaha Atif & 31 & 11\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Issue Tracker}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Authored (O+C)} & \textbf{Assigned (C only)}\\
\midrule
Name 1 & 3 & 0 \\
Name 2 & 2 & 0 \\
Name 3 & 2 & 0 \\
Name 4 & 0 & 0 \\
Name 5 & 0 & 0 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{CICD}

Our project utilizes Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD) to streamline development and maintain code quality. Our CICD pipeline includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Linter \& Formatter:} Automated linting and formatting tools ensure that all code adheres to a consistent style and best practices, reducing errors and improving readability.
    \item \textbf{LaTeX Generation:} Our pipeline automates the compilation of LaTeX documents, allowing for quick and consistent generation of project reports and documentation.
\end{itemize}

These automated processes help maintain a smooth development workflow, enforce coding standards, and ensure that documentation remains up to date.
