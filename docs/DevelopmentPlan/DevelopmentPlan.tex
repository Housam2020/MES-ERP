\section{Team Meeting Plan}

We will hold team meetings twice a week, either online or in person, based on availability and need. Advisor meetings will take place monthly through Teams unless urgent issues arise. In such cases, meetings may be held in person, depending on the severity of the matter and in consultation with the advisor.

\subsection{Meeting Structure}

\subsubsection{Team Meetings}
Each team member will share updates on completed tasks and current work. During this time, others can ask questions or provide feedback. After updates, we will discuss potential next steps and address any concerns as a group. Finally, each member will have an opportunity to raise questions or seek support on any challenges they are facing.

\subsubsection{Advisor Meetings}
We will begin by providing an overview of the project’s progress and potential next steps. The advisor will then have the opportunity to raise any concerns or provide guidance. We will conclude by discussing any questions or clarifications needed regarding the project.

\subsection{Meeting Roles}
The role of meeting chair will rotate among team members. Prior to advisor meetings, the team will collaboratively decide on the agenda and compile a list of questions and concerns to be addressed.

\section{Team Communication Plan}
In terms of team communication for this project, we will use discord as the main messaging platform. Discord will be used for messaging between the group members, to plan meetings, talk about issues, share resources and concepts. In addition, all group members will stay up to date on the GitHub issues to track any issue with their commits and be required to address (fix or simply respond) all their issues. Additionally, any merge conflicts or issues pushing or pulling code will be notified to team members via discord or if urgent through phone call.

\section{Team Member Roles}

We have assigned the following roles to team members, detailing their responsibilities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Meeting Chair: Taaha Atif}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Organizes and leads team meetings.
        \item Prepares the meeting agenda and ensures all topics are covered.
        \item Facilitates discussions and ensures that meetings run smoothly and on time.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Notetaker: Rachid Khneisser}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Takes detailed notes during meetings.
        \item Distributes meeting minutes to all team members after each meeting.
        \item Ensures that action items and decisions are clearly documented.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Reviewer: Sufyan Motala}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reviews all project documents and deliverables for accuracy and completeness.
        \item Provides feedback and suggestions for improvements.
        \item Ensures that all work meets the project’s quality standards.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Notetaker/Helper: Omar Muhammad}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reviews all project documents and deliverables for accuracy and completeness (with Rachid).
        \item Talks to anyone else in the group to see if they need assistance for any work.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Leader: Housam Alamour}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Oversees the overall progress of the project.
        \item Coordinates tasks and ensures that deadlines are met.
        \item Acts as the main point of contact between the team and the advisor.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Workflow Plan}

\subsection{Git Usage}
Git will be used to pull/push code (share code) between the group. The following practices will be followed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Branches}: Each feature or bug fix will be developed in its own branch. Branch names will follow a consistent naming convention.
  \item \textbf{Pull Requests (PRs)}: Pull requests will be used to merge changes from feature branches into the main branch. PRs will require at least one peer review before being merged to ensure code quality and adherence to project standards.
  \item \textbf{Commit Messages}: Commit messages will be descriptive about what changes have been made, what files this commit changes, and why these changes are required.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Issue Management}
Issues will be managed to ensure smooth progress and timely resolution of problems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Issue Templates}: Templates will be used for creating new issues to ensure all necessary information is provided. Templates will include sections for description, steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
    \item \textbf{Issue Classification}: Issues will be classified based on their type (e.g., bug, feature request, enhancement) and priority (e.g., high, medium, low).
    \item \textbf{Assignment}: Issues will be assigned to team members based on their expertise and availability. Team members can volunteer for issues or be assigned by the project manager.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CI/CD Implementation}
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) will be implemented to maintain code quality and streamline the development process:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Auto-formatting}: On commit, code will be auto-formatted to adhere to the project's coding standards.
    \item \textbf{Linting}: Linting will be performed via CI/CD to catch syntax and style issues early.
    \item \textbf{Static Analysis}: Static analysis will be conducted on committed code to identify potential issues and improve code quality.
    \item \textbf{Automated Testing}: Automated tests will be run on each commit to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

We will be using GitHub projects to manage tasks, track progress, and work efficiently together. 
GitHub projects will allow us to divide work into multiple tasks that every member can take on. 
Each task will be associated with a GitHub issue and will be categorized under appropriate columns. 
We will be using milestones for many of the deadlines our capstone has. Finally, GitHub itself will 
be used for version control, allowing us to efficiently share and work on our codebase. \\

Link: https://github.com/Housam2020/MES-ERP \\

Our project will be scheduled as such: \\

\begin{tabbing}

\end{tabbing}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\vspace{0.5cm}

The main risks for our project would be unexpected inputs from the reciepts we are 
given, this is the main purpose of the project so if it does not work 100 percent of the 
time it would be a failure on our part. To demonstrate success at the proof of concept
demo we will bring a variety of reciepts and demonstrate to everyone how our project operates.
We will show we can handle normal, boundary and unusual inputs with an appropriate response, and if 
this is done we can say we have successfully overcame the risk of being unable to handle some inputs. 

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\section{Expected Technology}
Please note that any specific technologies referenced in this section are merely suggestions and exist mainly as an illustrative example for what the potential product used for each section could be and what it's capabilities should be. These options are not fixed and are subject to be changed as the project continues to be developed.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Specific programming language:}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{TypeScript}: For this project, we will be using Typescript as it has been set out as a constraint by the supervisor for consistency reasons as many of the previous MES tools use this language. However, its benefits are that it provides static typing, which helps catch errors early and improves code quality. Additionally, it integrates well with Next.js, the other requirement for this project.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{Specific libraries:}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item First, we have a constraint that we must use Next.js imposed by the supervisor for similar reasons above as to why Typescript will be used. Our team wants to choose libraries that facilitate the development of a web application, as that is the main goal of our project. We are looking for libraries that help with server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing. We also need libraries that will help us sort through the old financial information as part of this project involves reading and parsing the old Excel documents that were used to keep track of financials for clubs in the past.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{Pre-trained models:}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Not applicable: This project does not involve machine learning, so no pre-trained models will be used.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{Specific linter tool (if appropriate):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The team will pick a linter tool to ensure code quality and consistency that will help to identify and fix problems in the codebase. It helps identify and fix problems in TypeScript code.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{Specific unit testing framework:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item  A unit testing framework such as Jest will be chosen to test the individual components, ensuring that each part of the application functions correctly.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{Investigation of code coverage measuring tools:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Code coverage tools will be used to measure the percent of the codebase tested, showing the team how to improve test coverage and code quality. This may be potentially done with Jest and GitHub actions. This will help ensure  that all parts of the codebase are tested.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI is not being done:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Continuous Integration (CI) tools will be implemented to automate the testing and deployment process. This will help ensure that code changes are continuously integrated and tested. GitHub Actions has most of the features needed for our development as it automates the testing and deployment process.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if appropriate:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item While not likely that we will need specific performance measuring tools for a web application, as this is not quite a real time system, we still want the tool to be responsive, fast and easy to use for all users. For this reason we will mostly be basing our performance tests off how long pages take to load on different hardware, and if needed we will utilize other tools like Lighthouse to assess the efficiency and speed of the application, identifying areas for optimization.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{Tools you will likely be using:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We will choose development tools and editors to increase productivity and streamline the development process. We want good "return on investment" for our time to implement and learn how to use any tools in this project. Thus, we will mainly be using tools already used by our team members. This includes Visual Studio Code: This code editor will be used for development. It offers a wide range of extensions and integrations that enhance productivity. We will also extensively be using GitHub and GitHub projects as part of this effort for version control.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project (answered as a group)?
        It is important to create a development plan prior to the project 
    because it can be used to guide us during our project. A development plan can ensure
    we stay on track and meet specific criteria/checkpoints throughout the timeline 
    of a project. It also reduces confusion since you will know generally what your agenda 
    will look like for upcoming weeks. 
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD (answered as a group)?
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them (answered as a group)?
    We had disagreements with team member roles, some students have a larger
    course load this semester, so to keep it reasonable we gave people with less courses this 
    semester slightly more work to do (but we will try to keep everything even if possible). We resolved 
    this by evaluating all of our course work and trying to remain fair to all teammates, we planned and talked 
    the course through and how we would plan it. So we decided to compromise on certain parts and were able to split
    the work in a way the whole group was happy with and in a way that is fair to the project itself (no one is gonna do 'no work').
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Appendix --- Team Charter}

\wss{borrows from
\href{https://engineering.up.edu/industry_partnerships/files/team-charter.pdf}
{University of Portland Team Charter}}

\subsection*{External Goals}
Our team’s external goals for this project are to further develop our skills as software engineers and gain hands-on experience in real-world project management and development. We aim to build a strong foundation of practical skills that we can confidently showcase in our resumes and discuss in interviews. We want to use this project to show our abilities when demonstrating our expertise and contributions to future employers.

\subsection*{Attendance}

\subsubsection*{Expectations}
All team members are expected to attend every meeting on time. If someone is delayed, they must notify the group in advance. If a member needs to leave early or miss a meeting for a valid reason, they are required to update the team on their progress via text and stay informed about the work and progress of others.

\subsubsection*{Acceptable Excuse}
Valid reasons for missing a meeting or deadline include family emergencies or severe illness that prevents the individual from working. Excuses like having a midterm or an upcoming assignment will not be considered acceptable.

\subsubsection*{In Case of Emergency}
In the event of an emergency, the work that was initially assigned to the affected team member will be equally distributed amongst the others to be completed. The team member that was unable to complete their work last time will have a slight increase in work for the next deliverable to make up.


\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

\subsubsection*{Quality} 
Team members are to be expected to have questions prepared for team meetings as well as a detailed understanding of what they are currently working on and what they have completed. This information is crucial as it will be required to present each team meeting. The quality of the deliverables that members bring to the team should be detailed and well done. The team is expected to look at the rubric while completing their portions for the deliverables.


\subsubsection*{Attitude}
All team members are expected to maintain a welcoming and open-minded attitude towards all ideas and suggestions. While discussions on the effectiveness of an idea are encouraged, no idea should be dismissed outright. Everyone is expected to collaborate and contribute to the task at hand. If conflicts arise, members involved are expected to communicate their concerns openly and work together to find a resolution as quickly as possible.

\subsubsection*{Stay on Track}
To keep the team on track, we will hold weekly meetings to review current progress and outline upcoming tasks. Each member will provide a brief summary of their contributions for the week. Members who fall behind compared to their peers will receive warnings and be encouraged to meet the group’s standards. Those who do not contribute at all will be reported to the professor or TA.

We will set a target number of commits for each team member. At the end of the month, the member with the highest number of commits will be rewarded with a free meal of their choice.
\subsubsection*{Team Building}
We will have bi-weekly meetups where we go for food or do an activity together.

\subsubsection*{Decision Making} 
All decisions will be made through a voting process. If a member strongly disagrees with the outcome, they must present their concerns and explain why an alternative option might be preferable. A revote can then be conducted based on this new information.
