\section{Team Meeting Plan}

We will hold team meetings twice a week, either online or in person, based on availability and need. Advisor meetings will take place monthly through Teams unless urgent issues arise. In such cases, meetings may be held in person, depending on the severity of the matter and in consultation with the advisor.

\subsection{Meeting Structure}

\subsubsection{Team Meetings}
Each team member will share updates on completed tasks and current work. During this time, others can ask questions or provide feedback. After updates, we will discuss potential next steps and address any concerns as a group. Finally, each member will have an opportunity to raise questions or seek support on any challenges they are facing.

\subsubsection{Advisor Meetings}
We will begin by providing an overview of the project’s progress and potential next steps. The advisor will then have the opportunity to raise any concerns or provide guidance. We will conclude by discussing any questions or clarifications needed regarding the project.

\subsection{Meeting Roles}
The role of meeting chair will rotate among team members. Prior to advisor meetings, the team will collaboratively decide on the agenda and compile a list of questions and concerns to be addressed.

\section{Team Communication Plan}
In terms of team communication for this project, we will use discord as the main messaging platform. Discord will be used for messaging between the group members, to plan meetings, talk about issues, share resources and concepts. In addition, all group members will stay up to date on the GitHub issues to track any issue with their commits and be required to address (fix or simply respond) all their issues. Additionally, any merge conflicts or issues pushing or pulling code will be notified to team members via discord or if urgent through phone call.

\section{Team Member Roles}

We have assigned the following roles to team members, detailing their responsibilities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Meeting Chair: Taaha Atif}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Organizes and leads team meetings.
        \item Prepares the meeting agenda and ensures all topics are covered.
        \item Facilitates discussions and ensures that meetings run smoothly and on time.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Notetaker: Rachid Khneisser}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Takes detailed notes during meetings.
        \item Distributes meeting minutes to all team members after each meeting.
        \item Ensures that action items and decisions are clearly documented.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Reviewer: Sufyan Motala}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reviews all project documents and deliverables for accuracy and completeness.
        \item Provides feedback and suggestions for improvements.
        \item Ensures that all work meets the project’s quality standards.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Leader: Housam Alamour}

        \item Oversees the overall progress of the project.
        \item Coordinates tasks and ensures that deadlines are met.
        \item Acts as the main point of contact between the team and the advisor.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Workflow Plan}

\subsection{Git Usage}
Git will be used to pull/push code (share code) between the group. The following practices will be followed:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Branches}: Each feature or bug fix will be developed in its own branch. Branch names will follow a consistent naming convention.
  \item \textbf{Pull Requests (PRs)}: Pull requests will be used to merge changes from feature branches into the main branch. PRs will require at least one peer review before being merged to ensure code quality and adherence to project standards.
  \item \textbf{Commit Messages}: Commit messages will be descriptive about what changes have been made, what files this commit changes, and why these changes are required.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Issue Management}
Issues will be managed to ensure smooth progress and timely resolution of problems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Issue Templates}: Templates will be used for creating new issues to ensure all necessary information is provided. Templates will include sections for description, steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
    \item \textbf{Issue Classification}: Issues will be classified based on their type (e.g., bug, feature request, enhancement) and priority (e.g., high, medium, low).
    \item \textbf{Assignment}: Issues will be assigned to team members based on their expertise and availability. Team members can volunteer for issues or be assigned by the project manager.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CI/CD Implementation}
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) will be implemented to maintain code quality and streamline the development process:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Auto-formatting}: On commit, code will be auto-formatted to adhere to the project's coding standards.
    \item \textbf{Linting}: Linting will be performed via CI/CD to catch syntax and style issues early.
    \item \textbf{Static Analysis}: Static analysis will be conducted on committed code to identify potential issues and improve code quality.
    \item \textbf{Automated Testing}: Automated tests will be run on each commit to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}
